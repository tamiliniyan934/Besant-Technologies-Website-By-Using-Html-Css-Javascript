                <h3> Easiest Way to learn Programming language</h3>
                <p>Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Besant technologies's most popular web development course.  This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development.
                    <br><br>
                    Web development is the act of building, creating and maintaining websites. The field encompasses a broad range of tasks including everything from coding, to technical design, to the performance of a website or application running on the internet. Web development consists of front-end and back-end components:
                    <br><br>
                    There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end and full-stack.Web development broadly encompasses the whole of a website's functionality, but the work itself is often broken down into three types: 
                    <br><br>
                    Front-end development is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact with: the user interface (UI). Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look and feel of the site, while also creating a quality user experience across multiple device types.
                     <br><br>
                   Back-end development is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see. This is also known as server-side development because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes logic, APIs and database interactions that power the site. 
                    <br><br>
                   Full-stack development is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible for the site or app take care of the entire development stack, from the inner workings typically performed on the back-end to the presentation layer normally handled by front-end
                   <br><br>
                   Web development is responsible for creating the sites and applications we use through a web browser in our day-to-day lives. Web developers, often working in teams or alongside other tech professionals like data scientists, UX designers and product managers, use specialized techniques and a thorough knowledge of one or more programming languages to create a foundation for where the websites database will live, known as a back-end. 
                   <br><br>
                   The back-end is dependent upon the websites server, which stores web pages and applications to be loaded into the web browser upon request.  The server acts as an intermediary between the web page or application and the data stored within the server, facilitating communication between the database and the client.
                   <br><br>
                   Web developers are also responsible for creating the front-end of a website through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which creates the layout and style that the user sees and interacts with when using the site.Finally, web developers are responsible for maintaining the site's functionality and overall performance over time.
